# CPU-Scheduling
CPU Scheduling using:
- First Come First Serve
- Priority Algorithm
- Round-Robin Algorithm

Files take in 'schedule.txt' file that contains eight tasks and their corresponding names, priority, and burst time.
Round-Robin uses quantum of 10 miliseconds.
Priority Algorithm sorts the data from greatest to smallest using priority. Once sorted First Come First Serve(FCFS) is applied.
